### Day 0: January 03, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created Birthday app skeleton in React, will add CSS tomorrow

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS (funny though I didn't have to change this) , but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it.

### Day 1: January 04, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added CSS to Birthday App and minor js refactoring, will continue with my reactjs lessons.

**Thoughts**: I am now understanding how css works after applying grid and flexbox layout. But a lot of time it feels like hit and trial. It needs some practice.

### Day 2: January 05, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued my ReactJs lessons on freeCodeCamp on useEffect React hooks.

**Thoughts** There is a lot going on under the hood in useEffect, I needed to make sure that I get a clarity on when it is re rendering and its use.

### Day 3: January 06, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Implemented useEffect hook using fetch api and learnt about multiple returns and short-circuit evaluations

**Thoughts**: UseEffect is an important topic with cleanup being important in it but overall it's worth revising.

### Day 4: January 07, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Implemented forms in react

**Thoughts**: Interesting exercise, Struggled a bit in CSS while centering buttons.
