# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!--
### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: January 03, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created Birthday app skeleton in React, will add CSS tomorrow

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS (funny though I didn't have to change this) , but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it.
